# event-registration-4
Please Note That :
- i have craeted the two Classes "Contact" and "Lead" class to use python seeters and getters
  in order to set constraints in attributes like name it will be mandatory in Contacts and Phone or Mail one of them 
  has to be provided before creating any New Contact , but i do not use them .
- phone number constrain "10 digits only with no breaks or brackets ... " has ben handeled in register function
- there might be misunderstanding of any point of requirements .
